Facial recognition model for creation of an emotion detection app 

README got reset... will work on full update from start to finish soon. This is work on the CNN model for my facial recognition app project, this model uses data from the [FER2013 dataset](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/fer2013#:~:text=FER2013%20(Facial%20Expression%20Recognition%202013%20Dataset)&text=machine%20learning%20contests-,Fer2013%20contains%20approximately%2030%2C000%20facial%20RGB%20images%20of%20different%20expressions,%3DSurprise%2C%206%3DNeutral.) and the base model creation was inspired by the work of [Ozioma Collins Oguine et al.](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2206/2206.09509.pdf)
